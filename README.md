# Projectile-Motion-Simulator

A simple projectile motion simulator made in Python/PyGame. In order for this to work, you need to download Python 3 and PyGame (here's a link on how to do so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FekDMDome4).

The simulator also solves the corresponding SUVAT parameters when you enter them. (E.g. You enter initial velocity and the angle of projection, the program will solve for you: vertical displacement,final velocity,time taken for the ball to fall back to the ground and the acceleration towards earth (which is always -9.8ms^-2 as we're using newtonian mechanics)).
